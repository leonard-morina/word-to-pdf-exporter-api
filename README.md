# Word to Pdf Exporter Api Repository

## About
This Project came as a need to export Word documents to PDF programmatically, while via LibreOffice we already had found a solution the problem is there are layout inconsistencies between Word and LibreOffice, so we felt like it's better to go back to finding a solution via Word, our solution was as follows:
* Developed the Word To Pdf Exporter Web API
* Host it in a Windows Server that has access to Microsoft Office Word.
* Make requests to the api and process them here.
* We should only be able to do one export at a time, so we will be using SQLite to manage to keep track of the pending requests and their statuses.

## ðŸš€ Quick start
* Clone the Repository
* Open solution in your preferred IDE/Text Editor
* Update Environment Variables by updating the [appsettings.Development.json](src/WordToPdfExporter.Api/appsettings.Development.json) file if needed.
* Run the project
